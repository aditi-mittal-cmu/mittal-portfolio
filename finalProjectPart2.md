<h1>Final Project - Part 2</h1>

<h2><i>Wireframe/Storyboarding</i></h2>

As outlined in part 1, I used "Shorthand" for storyboarding my story arc. The storyboard can be accessed at https://preview.shorthand.com/uFd0AR0o0Rklg7xJ

<h2><i>User Research</i></h2>

<h3>User research protocol</h3>
  
<h4>Target Audience</h4>
Through this project, I intend to highlight the extent of gender inequality existent in the world. The target audience for my project is "everyone". I think it is easy to become oblivious to this gender disparity, if it is something that we have not faced or if we come from a country which is not particularly low on the Gender Inequality Index. During the research for this project, I was myself alarmed at a lot of statistics. 
    
To further elaborate on who I mean by "everyone". It was important to get a mixed reaction of both "Men" and "Women", of varying ages - in their career. 
Due to the focus on the Tech industry, I wanted to interview women who have worked in the tech/consulting industry - to get their opinion on whether they have faced or seen gender bias. I also wanted to interview men, to understand if they were conscious of their surroundings and noticed some of these differences while working with female colleagues. I really hope that my message resonates with everyone at the level I feel is necessary to draw more attention. I also hope that this exercise gets people thinking how can they play a part in building a more just environment for women. 
  
  
Identifying Interview Candidates
In line with the description above of my target audience, I sought out individuals from came from different ethnic backgrounds with some corporate experience. My aim was to get as many diverse demographics as I could for the interview. This was my initial thought process for selecting candidates. I reached out to friends and friends of friends here.
<p>
  <ol type="1">
	  <li>Gender - All</li>
  	  <li>Race - All</li>
	  <li>Age: 22 onwards</li>
	  <li>Worked in a corporate setting - Yes</li>
	  <li>Country of Residence: Any</li>
</ol></p>
	

Interview Script
<p>To create the interview script, I employed the critique method that we used in "Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design" as I really liked the metrics that were evaluated, namely Usefulness, Completeness, Perceptibility, Truthfulness, Intuitiveness, Aesthetics and Engagement</p>

<p><i> I really enjoyed this exercise. Having done this before, I was a little more confident this time and less jittery. I was excited to share this story outline and see if the message was persuasive. I solicited feedback from three people who I am going to call Person 1, Person 2, Person 3, Person 4. Each person fit the demographic I initially identified for my target audience Everything mentioned in "" are direct quotes. </i></p>
 
<h3><b> Person 1 (Male)</b></h3>

<p><b> Could you describe to me what this is telling you? Does this visualization tell a story?</b></p>
<p><i>"That having better equality between genders has a good return-of-investment for countries and companies, but many leading countries are still missing out."</i></p>

<p><i>Person 1 mentioned two changes
  <ol type="1">

</ol></i></p>

<p><b>Did you learn something new and are you inspired to learn more about this topic?</b></p>
<p><i>"I did learn that quite a few countries are doing a better job than the US, and would be interested to learn how large that difference is."</i></p>

<h3><b> Person 2 (Female)</b></h3>

</ol></i></p>

<p><b>Did you learn something new and are you inspired to learn more about this topic?</b></p>
<p><i>"Though the gender gap is not something new, I was surprised that it would take us 100 years to close it. Some of the statistics mentioned were intriguing."</i></p>


<h3><b> Person 3 (Female)</b></h3>

<p><b> Could you describe to me what this is telling you? Does this visualization tell a story?</b></p>

<p><b>Is there enough persuasive information in the storyboard? If not, is there something else you'd like me to explore and add?</b></p>
<p><i>"I would like to see if any measures are being taken up by India and if there is any data to back the claim that Global Innovation Index is directly correlated to the gender pay index."</i></p>

<p><b>If you were to provide a one sentence summary of what you're seeing, what would it be?</b></p>
<p><i>"Looks pretty good and informative. I got an idea of where different coutries stand on gender neutrality - and how India is doing with respect to US and other countries."</i></p>

<p><b>Is there anything you would change or do differently?</b></p>
<p><i>Person 1 mentioned two changes
  <ol type="1">

</ol></i></p>

<p><b>Did you learn something new and are you inspired to learn more about this topic?</b></p>

<p><i>"What does global innovation index mean? The two graphs that you have shown do not show a direct correlation. Give examples of countries comparing the two statistics. 

In the section - ‘How is gender gap measured?’, you have mentioned - a) Health and Survival  b) Political empowerment, but I don’t see any explanation about these things. How are these related to the point that you are trying to drive?"</i></p>

<p><b>Did you learn something new and are you inspired to learn more about this topic?</b></p>
<p><i>"I liked the statistic about the global GDP, would definitely like to explore on how McKinsey came up with this. 
I also liked the statistic about CEOs and CFOs"</i></p>


<p> Once I got the feedback for my storyboard, I believe that the main idea of the story was coming - highlighting the prevalent gender inequality existing worldwide.</p>

<p><b>Things I have currently incorporated from the feedback. </b>
   <ol type="1">
     <li>Using the same chart to show both India and US's ranking over the years. I had originally added a toggle, which seemed unnecessary.</li>
     <li>I removed the concept of showing happiness index and it's correlation with gender equality as per the feedback from Part I - to concentrate the ideas together.</li>
     <li>Added appropriate headers for the story</li>
     <li>I did not include the graph for the factors determining Global Gender Pay Index in the storyboard as per the feedback from Part II</li>
     <li>Color coded the chart by region.(I am still trying to figure out how to add a custom legend for these regions)</li>   
     <li>Added a subtitle to explain what Global Innovation Index is on the chart.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p><b>Things I would be incorporating from the feedback and refining for the final presentation. </b>
   <ol type="1">
     <li>Layout and the use of pictures.</li>
     <li>Adding some more context on the correlation between the two bar graphs.</li>
     <li>Some more information on the different measures used to calculate the Gender Gap Index</li>
     <li>I think the idea of having two countries and explaining the statistics is great and I would like to test it out once.</li> 
    </ol>
