<h1>Final Project - Part 2</h1>

<h2><i>Wireframe/Storyboarding</i></h2>

As outlined in part 1, I used "Shorthand" for storyboarding my story arc. The storyboard can be accessed at 

<h2><i>User Research</i></h2>

<h3>User research protocol</h3>
  
<h4>Target Audience</h4>
Through this project, I intend to highlight the extent of gender inequality existent in the world,  especially in the Tech industry. The target audience for my project is     "everyone". I think it is easy to become oblivious to this gender disparity, if it is something that we have not faced or if we come from a country which is not particularly low on the Gender Inequality Index. During the research for this project, I was myself alarmed at a lot of statistics - 
    
To further elaborate on who I mean by "everyone". It was important to get a mixed reaction of both "Men" and "Women", of varying ages - in their adult career. 
Due to the focus on the Tech industry, I wanted to interview women who have worked in the tech/consulting industry - to get their opinion on whether they have faced or seen gender bias. I also wanted to interview men, to understand if they were conscious of their surroundings and noticed some of these differences. I really hope that my message resonates with everyone at the level I feel is necessary to draw more attention. I also hope that this exercise gets people thinking how can they play a part in building a more just environment for women. 
  
  
Identifying Interview Candidates
In line with the description above of my target audience, I sought out individuals from came from different ethnic backgrounds with some corporate experience. My aim was to get as many diverse demographics as I could for the interview. This was my initial thought process for selecting candidates. I reached out to friends and friends of friends here.
	• Gender - All
	• Race - All
	• Age: 22 onwards
	• Worked in a corporate setting - Yes
	• Country of Residence: Any

Interview Script
To create the interview script, I employed the critique method that we used in "Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design" as I really liked the metrics that were evaluated, namely Usefulness, Completeness, Perceptibility, Truthfulness, Intuitiveness, Aesthetics and Engagement

<p><i> I really enjoyed this exercise. Having done this before, I was a little more confident this time and less jittery. I was excited to share this story outline and see if the message was persuasive. I solicited feedback from three people who I am going to call Person 1, Person 2 and Person 3. Each person fit the demographic I initially identified for my target audience Everything mentioned in "" are direct quotes. </i></p>
