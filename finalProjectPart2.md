<h1>Final Project - Part 2</h1>

<h2><i>Wireframe/Storyboarding</i></h2>

As outlined in part 1, I used "Shorthand" for storyboarding my story arc. The storyboard can be accessed at https://preview.shorthand.com/uFd0AR0o0Rklg7xJ

<h2><i>User Research</i></h2>

<h3>User research protocol</h3>
  
<h4>Target Audience</h4>
Through this project, I intend to highlight the extent of gender inequality existent in the world,  especially in the Tech industry. The target audience for my project is     "everyone". I think it is easy to become oblivious to this gender disparity, if it is something that we have not faced or if we come from a country which is not particularly low on the Gender Inequality Index. During the research for this project, I was myself alarmed at a lot of statistics - 
    
To further elaborate on who I mean by "everyone". It was important to get a mixed reaction of both "Men" and "Women", of varying ages - in their career. 
Due to the focus on the Tech industry, I wanted to interview women who have worked in the tech/consulting industry - to get their opinion on whether they have faced or seen gender bias. I also wanted to interview men, to understand if they were conscious of their surroundings and noticed some of these differences. I really hope that my message resonates with everyone at the level I feel is necessary to draw more attention. I also hope that this exercise gets people thinking how can they play a part in building a more just environment for women. 
  
  
Identifying Interview Candidates
In line with the description above of my target audience, I sought out individuals from came from different ethnic backgrounds with some corporate experience. My aim was to get as many diverse demographics as I could for the interview. This was my initial thought process for selecting candidates. I reached out to friends and friends of friends here.
<p>
  <ol type="1">
	  <li>Gender - All</li>
  	  <li>Race - All</li>
	  <li>Age: 22 onwards</li>
	  <li>Worked in a corporate setting - Yes</li>
	  <li>Country of Residence: Any</li>
</ol></p>
	

Interview Script
To create the interview script, I employed the critique method that we used in "Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design" as I really liked the metrics that were evaluated, namely Usefulness, Completeness, Perceptibility, Truthfulness, Intuitiveness, Aesthetics and Engagement

<p><i> I really enjoyed this exercise. Having done this before, I was a little more confident this time and less jittery. I was excited to share this story outline and see if the message was persuasive. I solicited feedback from three people who I am going to call Person 1, Person 2 and Person 3. Each person fit the demographic I initially identified for my target audience Everything mentioned in "" are direct quotes. </i></p>
 
<h3><b> Person 1</b></h3>

<p><b> Could you describe to me what this is telling you? Does this visualization tell a story?</b></p>
<p><i>"That having better equality between genders has a good return-of-investment for countries and companies, but many leading countries are still missing out."</i></p>

<p><b> Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?</b></p>
<p><i>"It surprised me to not see America in the list of countries with the gender gap."</i></p>

</ol></i></p>

<p><b>Did you learn something new and are you inspired to learn more about this topic?</b></p>

<h3><b> Class exercise feedback</b></h3>
<p>I decided to also document the feedback that I received in the in-class exercise as I thought some great points were raised. </p>

<b>What worked?</b>
<p><i>
</i></p>

<b>What didn't work?</b>
<p><i>
</i></p>

<b>What questions came up?</b>
<p><i></i></p>

<b>What new inspiration arose?</b>
<p><i></i></p>

<p> Once I got the feedback for my storyboard, I believe that the main idea of the story was coming - highlighting the prevalent gender inequality existing worldwide.</p>

<p><b>Things I would like to incorporate from the feedback. </b>
   <ol type="1">
     <li>Using the same chart to show both India and US's ranking over the years. I had originally added a toggle, which seemed unnecessary.</li>
     <li>I removed the concept of showing happiness index and it's correlation with gender equality as per the feedback from Part I - to concentrate the ideas together.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p><b>Things I would be incorporating from the feedback and refining for the final presentation. </b>
   <ol type="1">
     <li>Layout and the use of pictures.</li>
     <li> </li>
     <li></li>
     <li></li> 
    </ol>
</p>

<p><b>Things that I believe are "Good to haves" but may not align with the current project scope. </b>
   <ol type="1">
     <li> </li>
     <li> </li>
     <li>.</li>
