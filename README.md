# About me

Hi! I am Aditi (She/Hers), a Masters of Information Systems Management student at Carnegie Mellon University.

Prior to pursuing masters, I worked as a  lead techno-functional consultant at Microsoft for 5 years. During this time, I primarily worked on Dynamics 365, a Customer Relationship Management product, helping organizations migrate to this cloud based platform. I have had experience in both, private and public sectors across diverse domains like government, e-commerce, retail. I managed different stakeholders, engaged with clients to understand their business requirements and provided solutions specific to their business case. I loved working at the intersection of people, technology and business and would like to segue into Product Mangement post my masters. 

Outside of work, I like to read novels (mostly fiction), painting, meeting new people and traveling. I also support several non-profit organizations and love volunteering in my free time. 

# What I hope to learn
We are living in a world where a humungous amount of data is generated everyday.  It has become even more important to efficiently understand and be able to communicate with this data, which is ultimately my main expectation out of this course. 

Particularly, I am extremely interested to learn how to create impactful visualization, explore the art of storytelling through data and visuals, look at the best critiquing techniques and employ them in real-world scenarios. I also hope to learn skills/tools that can help me engage better with different kind of audiences and create persuasive presentations.
