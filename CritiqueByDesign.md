# Critique by Design


<h2>Step one: find a data visualization</h2>




<h2>Step two: critique the data visualization</h2>

<p>The citique method that we used here analysed the following metrics</p>






<h2>Step three: wireframe a solution</h2>




<h2>Step four: Test the solution</h2>

<p> This was by far the most exciting step for me. Asking people to look at a visualization I created while providing them with little or no context was scary at first. 
    I wondered what if none of this makes sense to anyone but I was surprised with the positive critique and insights from people. I solicited feedback from
    two people who I am going to call Person 1 and Person 2. Everything mentioned in "" are direct quotes. </p>
    
<p><b> Person 1</b></p>

<p><b> Could you tell me what you think this visualization is?</b></p>
<p><i>"I think this is graph for top economies in 2017 & prediction of their GDP in 2030. (Continuous vs Dotted lines uses for present and future respectively)."</i></p>

<p><b> COuld you describe to me what this is telling you?</b></p>
<p><i>"This is telling me that GDP of US won’t grow as much as India’s GDP."</i></p>


<p><b> Could you describe to me what this is telling you?</b></p>
<p><i>"This is telling me that GDP of US won’t grow as much as India’s GDP."</i></p>

<p><b> Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?</b></p>
<p><i>"It is surprising that India will overtake USA in terms of GDP, that too by a huge margin."</i></p>


<p><b>Who do you think is the intended audience for this?</b></p>
<p><i>"Someone who would want to know about GDPs (students who are studying social studies )"</i></p>

<p><b>Is there anything you would change or do differently?</b></p>
<p><i>Person 1 mentioned two changes
  <ol type="1">
  <li>"Heading says 10 largest economies and I see only 6. I may add 4 more countries."</li>
  <li>"I see the countries that you have considered for Asia are marked in green. Are those the only 3 countries you have taken for Asia ? This is not clear, 
 I might make it more explicit what countries are included in Asia"</li>
</ol></i></p>


<p><b> Person 2</b></p>

<p><b> Could you tell me what you think this visualization is?</b></p>
<p><i>"List of top 10 world economies. Prediction of the GDP value for the 2030 mark based on the 2017 data."</i></p>

<p><b>Could you describe to me what this is telling you?</b></p>
<p><i>"Prediction of the GDP value for the 2030 mark based on the 2017 data for different countries. Colour green is being used for Asia. 
  Dotted lines shows projected growth and dark lines show the GDP growth in 2017. The chart is showing the projected 2030 GDP values in 
  descending order with China leading the market. "</i></p>


<p><b>Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?</b></p>
<p><i>In terms of the data presented, "It was surprising that some lower rank countries overtook higher rank countries like India upsets the US in 2030. Also, it is clear that China retains it's position of number 1 into the year 2030".
In terms of the visualization, it was unclear what was the current and predicted rank. Including today's date would have given a reference point to how old this data is. For example, Is 2017 the current year or past year?
</i></p>

<p><b>Who do you think is the intended audience for this?</b></p>
<p><i>"Predominantly economists, people who know the basics of economics and can comprehend and draw significance from the projected growth".</i></p>


<p><b>Is there anything you would change or do differently?</b></p>
<p><i>	1. Instead of using a bar chart to show the rise of Asia, Person 2 mentioned that they would prefer a line chart.
	2. Add a different table to show the ranks of the countries in 2017 and 2030. 
	3. The chart showed only 6 countries while the title read 10 countries. 
</i></p>


<p> Once I got the feedback for my graph, I showed the original chart to get a comparative feedback. 
Person 1 found the chart to be very visually appealing but the difference between GDP values for the countries was not apparent or easily understandable. 
Person 2 found the bar chart more intuitive and called the original chart "confusing" and "extra". In addition to the above general feedback,
he added that the map shown for India on the right seemed ambiguous. The text was an inference from the GDP values for
both the years and the heading "World's fastest growing cities, by annual population growth" made it unclear if all the cities were actually
in India or just the ones in India were listed.  He added that I could consider showing that in a different way. </p>

<p>In general, I believe the idea of the what the chart represents was coming through and was clearly identifiable. </p>

<p>Things I would like to incorporate from the feedback. 
   <ol type="1">
     <li>Adding an additional table to show the ranks. </li>
     <li>Changing the Asia chart to a line instead of a bar. </li>
     <li>As for the countries, I ran out of space. So the final chart will have 10 countries, as stated in the title.</li>
     <li>Include a legend for continents</li> 
</p>

<p>Things I would not be incorporating currently 
 1.  Adding a different representation for India map </p>

    
    
  <p>For each step above, you should document your progress (think of it as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process).  
 You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering a redesign, 
  if anything.  You should talk about how you moved next to the wireframes, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback. 
  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows,
  why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently. 

Include screenshots of your wireframes or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  
  Make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list their full names, etc.). </p>
