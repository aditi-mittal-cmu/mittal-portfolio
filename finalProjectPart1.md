# Final Project Part 1

<h2>Outline</h2>

<b><i>A woman in Tech</i></b>

I know that a lot has already been said about "Gender inequality", "Pay gaps" etc, but as a woman who worked in the tech consulting world, these glaring differences in how men and women are perceived - hit close to home. We have definitely come a long way, but as someone who comes from a country which ranks poorly on Gender equality score (India slipped 28 places to rank 140th among 156 countries in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2021, becoming the third-worst performer in South Asia), I believe that this is a story worth talking about. 

Very recently, a friend of mine shared this article with me "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/gender-inequality-man-woman-switch-names-week-martin-schneider-nicky-knacks-pay-gap-a7622201.html?amp". This was published in 2017, where in a man and a woman switched their email signatures and the differences in how they were perceived/ treated was hard to ignore. What was surprising about this article? Nothing, actually. I remember thinking, "That makes sense, I've always had to work harder - to be acknowledged, respected". Things have not changed much since 2017 for women in the workplace.

Now, if look at all the countries and their rankings from best to worst - we see the four Nordic countries, Iceland, Norway, Finland, and Sweden at the top. Again, this doesn't come as a shock because all these countries have a high happiness index too. Could gender equality drive happiness index? Let's find out. 

Eventually, I would be diving deeper into the gender gap prevalent in the Tech industry, discussing typically the scenario in the US and India. 

The ultimate aim of this project is to highlight the gender inequality existing in the world and how we can work towards building a more inclusive and just environment for women. Despite the gender diversity in tech, women are still underrepresented, underpaid, and often discriminated against in the tech industry. 

<i>Project Structure</i>

In general, I would like start with an overview of how the Global Gender Gap Index  Index is measured and talk about the different parameters. The index measures inequality in achievements between women and men across the below dimensions.
 1. Economic Participation and Opportunity
 2. Educational Attainment
 3. Health and Survival
 4. Power Empowerment

Then I would like to go into the global rankings - where do the countries stand on gender equality? An analysis of the last 5-10 years. 
 1. What countries are considered high performers in tech or consulting? Looking at their innovation index and their correlation with gender equality?
 2. Looking at the correlation of happiness index and gender equality? 

Has the pandemic exacerbated this gap? An analysis of the worst hit countries. 
I remember reading an article from McKinsey Global Institute that estimates that women have suffered more than half of total job losses from the crisis, even though they make only two-fifths of the global labour force. This was an alarming statistic. 

Tech Giants - Is it still a man's world? 
	• Men to women overall representation
	• Income gaps
	• Positions of power held by men vs women

Where does US and India stand? What does the future look like?

Parting thoughts. What actions can we collectively take? This is the call to action portion. I would be providing some concrete steps that the audience can take to educate themselves on the matter further, petitions that they could sign to urge companies, policy makers to tackle the underlying issues.  


<h2>Sketches</h2>

Currently these sketches are just an overall idea of the what kind of data representations I'd like to do. Will be refining them once I start working with the datasets.

 1. What parameters drive Gender Inequality (GI)?

 2. Top performing countries - what countries are gender equal?

 Where is India heading?

 3. Gender Gap in Tech

 4. Where are we heading - optimism around gender equality?
    General discussion on where we are heading - number of years it would take to close out on the gender gap across different regions.

<h2>Data</h2>

These are some of the data sources that I would be referring to for my visualizations

https://www.who.int/data/nutrition/nlis/info/gender-inequality-index-(gii) (Definition) This is for introducing the topic and talking about how the gender inequality index is measured worldwide. 

https://www.oecd.org/gender/data/ - This has the data on employment per gender across the countries.

http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/101706 (United Nations Development Programme) 
I would be using the inequality in income dataset from this site. This has the information from 2010 - 2019 across countries. 

https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gender-equality-by-country (Country ranking data) This site includes the data for each country and where they stand on the gender equality scale. 


https://www.wipo.int/global_innovation_index/en/2020/ The global innovation index measures the success of each country. 


https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm This has the dataset on the number of Employed persons by detailed occupation, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. I would be using this to show the gender gap in tech industry. 

These are some preliminary data sources that I could find, which would allow me to implement the sketches above. 


<h2>Method and Medium</h2>

I would like to explore Shorthand for the storytelling part. I really like how intuitive and easy to use their interface is for creating immersive stories. Further, to build the visualizations, I would primarily be using Flourish and Tableau. Since, flourish is restrictive in terms of the customizations available (based on the challenges that I faced during the assignments), I think tableau would be the go-to alternative for more involved/complex visualizations. As a call to action, I think I would do a petition/poll. 

In terms of progressing forward, I plan clean up some of the data that I found online and convert it into a format that I could use. I would also start building the initial visualizations using flourish and tableau. Parallelly , I would also be doing some more research to identify if there are any other data sources or story ideas that I could incorporate into my main story. I would also be building my story using shorthand based on my project outline and sketches. Lastly, I would be working on doing the final presentation.
