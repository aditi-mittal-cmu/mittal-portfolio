# Critique by Design


<h2>Step one: find a data visualization</h2>

<p>The visualization that I picked up for this assignment is a list of 10 world economies in 2030. The chart was featured as the chart of the week, in the weekly Visual Capitalist feature in January 2019. This was based on the forecast made by Standard Chartered, a multinational bank headquartered in London. The data for 2017 was taken from IMF's 2017 data source.</p>

I particularly chose this visualization because of some of the surprises that came up in the story - the projection of India overtaking the US. Absence of UK in the top 10 list and countries such as Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt and Brazil all higher up in the list than UK. Additionally, the growth shown for Egypt was deemed ambitious when this article came out. Though this is an old article, I remember reading about it at the time the list was released. Also, I believe the idea that today’s emerging markets are tomorrow’s powerhouses was an interesting idea to take in. Since this is pre-pandemic data, it would also be interesting to see if any predictions have been affected because of COVID-19. 

In terms of how the data was represented, I saw a lot of potential for following a different approach - changing the type of visualization, limiting the use of colours, and reducing/editing the text used on the chart. 


<h2>Step two: critique the data visualization</h2>

<p>The citique method that we used here analysed the following metrics : Usefulness, Completeness, Perceptibility, Truthfulness, Intuitiveness, Aesthetics and Engagement.
Overall, I think this visualization was a very informative one, the title and subtitle were simple but clear, but I would have rather used a different mode of visualization. In partcular, the critique helped me better articulate how I would like to proceed with the modifications. </p>

This chart was visually very appealing given the use of so many colours and images but that was one of the things that I found very distracting too. I was immediately drawn to learn how India was projected to rank above the US, so in that regard the chart definitely got me more interested in the data presented. 

When I first looked at the chart, my mind was automatically drawn to the solar system, the way each country was represented, the descending order, use of colour and the galaxy effect. After spending a little more time, I got a sense of what was being represented. There were a few things that I found unnecessary, like the chart for India. Would economists be interested in those cities particularly? Are those the highest growing cities in the world or just India? Would a world map be better to show the scale of comparison? In terms of the data presented, the forecast was done by Standard Chartered, which seems like a credible source.  The chart seemed too long, there was a considerable amount of eye travel to have a look at all the countries. Though the text data added is very informative and presented neatly, I think it was a lot and could be trimmed down. I also found myself wondering a few things - like was there a specific reason for the choice of colours? Was the idea to use the flag colour? 

<p>Once I was able to discern who the chart was intended for, I realized it made more sense to have a simple chart represent the information around emerging markets, Asia's growth and furture prediction and the change in countries rank into the projected year. I would assume that Economists would rather prefer a simple, concise chart to a ostensible one. To this point, I decided to use a bar chart to show the GDP values for the countries</p>

<p> When I delved deeper into the usefulness of the chart, it was apparent that one of the major highlights was how Asia's slice of the global GDP pie has risen over the years. Since I am not a big fan of pie charts - I would have gone for a pie/line chart here, showing the rise trend. 


There are a couple of things that I would do differently, which I tried to incorporate into the wireframes below. 
Firstly, I would go for a stacked bar chart to represent both the 2017 GDP and 2030 GDP projections for the 10 countries. I personally find that bar charts are very effective to show ranks and an overall data comparison across years. Secondly, I would also use a bar chart to show the growth of Asia's GDP over the years into the 2030 projection.  While the pie chart is also working in this case, but in case the number of years were greater than three, I think the bar chart would be easier to comprehend. And lastly, I limited the use of colours and grouped them by region. Some of the messages that were stressed upon was how Asia's slice of the global GDP is increasing - this would be more intuitive if the countries in Asia were the same colour. 


<h2>Step three: wireframe a solution</h2>

<p> Once I had a better understanding of what all aspects I wanted to touch in the original chart, I began wireframing. I went through two versions here - the first one to get a rough idea of how it would look in reality and the second one was a revised version that I shared with people in the next step. </p>

<p><b>Wireframe 1</b></p>

<p>My thought process here was to see how the data could be represented as a stacked column bar - countries on the y-axis and GDP on the x-axis. Then I began thinking about how I wanted to differentiate between existing data and projected data. I used dashed line to show the 2030 projections and a solid line for the 2017 projections. I added both the ranking - 2017 and 2030. </p>

<p><b>Wireframe 2</b></p>

<p>My thought process here was to further use colours to show how the regions are doing. I didn't show the 2030 rankings since I sorted the countries in descending order and thought that those ranks were intuitive. This was a change from the previous wireframe. I added a second chart to show how Asia's GDP slice has grown since 2010. </p>

I created a simple table to show the rank change of the countries. A side by side comparision between the 2017 and 2030 rankings and denoted a a decrease in ranking as green (positive colour) and increase in rank as red (hot colour).

<p><b>After incorporating the feedback from people, I created a few more wireframes to test them out</b></p>

I changed the visualization to show both the projected and initial value as a single bar to see how it would look like. I also added a legend to show the region groupings and chart titles and subtitles to be more descriptive. 

I also changed the visualization to show Asia's growth into a line chart instead of a bar chart. This did look more intuitive than the bar chart version before.

<h2>Step four: Test the solution</h2>

<p><i> This was by far the most exciting step for me. Asking people to look at a visualization I created while providing them with little or no context was scary at first. 
    I wondered what if none of this makes sense to anyone but I was surprised with the positive critique and insights from people. I solicited feedback from
    two people who I am going to call Person 1 and Person 2. Everything mentioned in "" are direct quotes. </i></p>
    
<h3><b> Person 1</b></h3>

<p><b> Could you tell me what you think this visualization is?</b></p>
<p><i>"I think this is graph for top economies in 2017 & prediction of their GDP in 2030. (Continuous vs Dotted lines uses for present and future respectively)."</i></p>

<p><b> Could you describe to me what this is telling you?</b></p>
<p><i>"This is telling me that GDP of US won’t grow as much as India’s GDP."</i></p>


<p><b> Could you describe to me what this is telling you?</b></p>
<p><i>"This is telling me that GDP of US won’t grow as much as India’s GDP."</i></p>

<p><b> Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?</b></p>
<p><i>"It is surprising that India will overtake USA in terms of GDP, that too by a huge margin."</i></p>


<p><b>Who do you think is the intended audience for this?</b></p>
<p><i>"Someone who would want to know about GDPs (students who are studying social studies )"</i></p>

<p><b>Is there anything you would change or do differently?</b></p>
<p><i>Person 1 mentioned two changes
  <ol type="1">
  <li>"Heading says 10 largest economies and I see only 6. I may add 4 more countries."</li>
  <li>"I see the countries that you have considered for Asia are marked in green. Are those the only 3 countries you have taken for Asia ? This is not clear, 
 I might make it more explicit what countries are included in Asia"</li>
</ol></i></p>


<h3><b> Person 2</b></h3>

<p><b> Could you tell me what you think this visualization is?</b></p>
<p><i>"List of top 10 world economies. Prediction of the GDP value for the 2030 mark based on the 2017 data."</i></p>

<p><b>Could you describe to me what this is telling you?</b></p>
<p><i>"Prediction of the GDP value for the 2030 mark based on the 2017 data for different countries. Colour green is being used for Asia. 
  Dotted lines shows projected growth and dark lines show the GDP growth in 2017. The chart is showing the projected 2030 GDP values in 
  descending order with China leading the market. "</i></p>


<p><b>Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?</b></p>
<p><i>In terms of the data presented, "It was surprising that some lower rank countries overtook higher rank countries like India upsets the US in 2030. Also, it is clear that China retains it's position of number 1 into the year 2030".
In terms of the visualization, it was unclear what was the current and predicted rank. Including today's date would have given a reference point to how old this data is. For example, Is 2017 the current year or past year?
</i></p>

<p><b>Who do you think is the intended audience for this?</b></p>
<p><i>"Predominantly economists, people who know the basics of economics and can comprehend and draw significance from the projected growth".</i></p>


<p><b>Is there anything you would change or do differently?</b></p>
<p><i>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Instead of using a bar chart to show the rise of Asia, Person 2 mentioned that they would prefer a line chart.</li>
		<li>Add a different table to show the ranks of the countries in 2017 and 2030. </li>
		<li>The chart showed only 6 countries while the title read 10 countries. </li>
	</ol>
</i></p>

<h3><b> Class exercise feedback</b></h3>
<p>I decided to also document the feedback that I received in the in-class exercise as I thought some great points were raised. </p>

What worked?
<p><i>
1. Top to bottom 
2. Region grouped by colour
</i></p>

What didn't work?
<p><i>
1. The ranks were not clear.
2. Projected value and current value gained a mixed response. 
3. Title could have been more specific.
</i></p>

What questions came up?
<p><i>1. The bar chart for Asia - what were the % for?</i></p>

What new inspiration arose?
<p><i>1. Someone mentioned to try showing the projected and current value in the same bar, the projected one as an extension.</i></p>

<p> Once I got the feedback for my graph, I showed the original chart to get a comparative feedback. 
Person 1 found the chart to be very visually appealing but the difference between GDP values for the countries was not apparent or easily understandable. 
Person 2 found the bar chart more intuitive and called the original chart "confusing" and "extra". In addition to the above general feedback,
he added that the map shown for India on the right seemed ambiguous. The text was an inference from the GDP values for
both the years and the heading "World's fastest growing cities, by annual population growth" made it unclear if all the cities were actually
in India or just the ones in India were listed.  He added that I could consider showing that in a different way. In the class exercise, they also found the original
chart beautiful but not helpful.</p>

<p>In general, I believe the idea of the what the chart represents was coming through and was clearly identifiable. </p>

<p><b>Things I would like to incorporate from the feedback. </b>
   <ol type="1">
     <li>Adding an additional table to show the ranks. </li>
     <li>Changing the Asia chart to a line instead of a bar. </li>
     <li>As for the countries, I ran out of space. So the final chart will have 10 countries, as stated in the title.</li>
     <li>Include a legend for continents</li> 
    </ol>
</p>

<p>Things I would not be incorporating currently 
 <ol type="1">
	 <li>1.  Adding a different representation for India map</li>
 </ol>
</p>
  

<h2>Step five: Build your solution</h2>

These are the visualizations that I redesigned using flourish. 

<p>One thing that I couldn't figure out was how to make the projection dashed line in flourish.</p>
