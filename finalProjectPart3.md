<i><h1>Part III: Final project and presentation</h1>

<h2>How it started?</h2>
<p>Here's a link to go back to the [Part I](finalProjectPart1.md) of my project. This was the brainstorming phase - a high level project idea, project structure, data sources.</p>

<h2>How it progressed?</h2>
<p>Here's a link to go back to the [Part II](finalProjectPart2.md) of my project. This was the implementation phase, to finally put my thoughts into motion. I went through several iterations here. I used shorthand to build the story arc. This primarily included storyboarding and user research. </p>

<h3><i>Audience for the project</i></h3>

<p>Since the scope of my audience  was large, and was not targeted, the key things that I thought about while revising was whether it all flew together and made sense. 

I didn't have a single persona for my target audience - the reason being that gender equality is not limited by boundaries. I kept my demographics diverse - An American male, An Asian male and two Asian women. I think my message was relevant to everyone - in the sense that all of us need to be more aware of what the situation. I would have liked to get more feedback but due to the lack of time, it weren't possible - however, it was unequivocally clear that there was a general lack of awareness around some of the statistics concerning gender equality. 

Further, based on the feedback on what next steps could the audience take, I suggested several Call to Actions - including a list of Non-for profits, petitions.</p>

<h3><i>Changes made since completion of Part 2</i></h3>

<p>There were a couple of changes that I made to my Part 2 submission. 

Based on the feedback from the TA, I added two graphs to substantiate how COVID particularly hit India and exacerbated the gender gap, causing a drop of 38 ranks. 
I used 

Again, based on the feedback received from the professor, I tried to incorporate iconography to show certain statistics and parameters. 
This really made the visualization more appealing. 
To show the ratio of number of women CEO to men CEO, as well as woman CFO to men CFO, I used pictogram chart from flourish. It was easy to use and definitely more intuitive than the pictures I had employed originally.

Since I added a couple of graphs, the scrollable content was a lot, and I wanted to decrease that. So, instead of sticking with the Call to content as a vertical scroll, I used the flourish Cards visualization. Since, this was horizontal, it took up less space and looked more visually interactive. 

Last minute, I also decided to change the ordering of the Gender Gap Index and Global Innovation Index charts. I think that flowed more logically. 

I think at one point I was a little brain dead, so taking a break, helped me to come up with ideas. 
One aspect I struggled with was getting the right photos which were under the creatives license. It was very difficult to find the kind of photos I needed, eventually I decided to add my own photo for the title. In hindsight, I think that ended up giving it a personal touch. 

I also added the literacy rate column for the top 25 countries Gender Gap Index chart. I didn't have the time to go into the granular details during the presentation, but the idea was to support how Nordic countries have high-literacy rates that helped them close the Gender Gap. 

Another feedback I had received was that there was some inconsistency in the colouring scheme of the two bar charts and the bifurcation via regions was not coming across. This was actually because of an oversight while setting the custom colours, so I corrected that and to highlight European countries I went a shade darker than the original pastel pink. 

I had incorporated most of the feedback from the interviews in my part 2 submission, some of them were left because of time constraints.
These were the pending items
<b>Layout and the use of pictures</b> - I made changes to the layout, added slicers, changed the images to use creative commons license images.
<b>Adding some more context on the correlation between the two bar graphs</b> - I added a link to a paper that actually talks about the correlation. 
<b>Some more information on the different measures used to calculate the Gender Gap Index<b> - I did not want to go into the depth of how the Gender Gap Index was calculated. While, this was a great feedback, I left it out for project scope constraints. 
<b>I think the idea of having two countries and explaining the statistics is great and I would like to test it out once </b>-  I tried to play around with two countries - India and US but the amount of information on the story ended up being humongous and I stuck to having information only about India. Plus, I thought the european (nordic) countries already provided that competitive benchmarking. 
  
I also changed the title to something less personal. Though originally I had envisioned adding a more personal touch, I decided against it since it is a public portfolio and I did not want to include any employer specific story.

Now, when I reflect back on the entire journey, I think the key to getting better at visualizations was trying out different options, I definitely found an improvement in myself in terms of the amount of time I spent on creating visualizations. Another aspect that was particularly challenging at first was the 1 minute presentation. Understanding what key elements to include in the presentations, such that it still flows coherently and conveys the overall intent was very difficult. After multiple iterations, I was finally able to do it all under 1 minute. 

Overall, I am happy that I was able to stick with my original idea and the process in between helped me refine it into an impactful story.</p>
